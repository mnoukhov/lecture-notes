# Intro

What do you need for an avalanche?
- snowpack
- avalanche terrain
- trigger
- a person

## Snowpack

Snowpack
- *uniform*: all snow is the same
- *isotherm*: all snow is same temp? humidity?

Formation
- variation during snow storm (temp, wind, humidity)
- compaction (melting and refreezing)

### Layers
We want cohesive layers of snow
- ideally firm and uniform

shapes
- *round* good crystal
- *facets* (square) bad crystal
- *crust* no more crystal
- *depth* and *surface hoar* are worst

temperature
- colder makes harder to link
- warmer has humidity that makes it easier to link up

changes
- facets can turn into round if reduced moisture
- round can turn into facets with moisture

### Strength

Strength of layers
- thickness: more is better
- types of layers
- depth: deeper layers are more protected, 30-85cm is worst
- fracture type: how layers break, weak layer or weak link?

*instability*: is there a weak link in the snowpack
*force*: how much energy do you need to break the snowpack
*propogation*: will the break cause more breaks

## Avalanche

### Instabilities

storm snow
- last snow becomes a layer but doesn't bind to layer below
- problem in first 48 hours
persistent slab
- slab layer above facets, crust, or hoar
deep slab
- persistent slab deep in snow
loose snow
- large crystals that don't bind
- cold, but not windy
wind slab
- wind moved snow and made it cohesive
cornice fall
- wind moved snow, but different terrain to wind slab
wet avalanches
- too much water inside snowpack

### Types

loose snow avalanche
- small object triggers loose snow
- won't bury but can cause crashes / trauma

slab avalanche
- triggered by fracture along *crown*
- can be far away
- gliding, then dry flowing, then powder

wet snow avalanche
- smaller, slower but longer, more destructive

### Classification

1. relatively harmless
2. can bury, injure, kill
3. bury destroy car, trees
4. destroy truck, buildings, small forest
5. largest known, could destroy village


### Trigger Factors

natural
- new snow 
- temp change
- sun/rain
- earth quake
human, larger weight added faster
- skier
- snowmobile
- machinery
- explosive

## Avalanche Terrain

path
- start zone
    - crown
    - crown face
    - bed surface
- track
    - staunchwall
- run out zone
    - debris

### Characteristics of Terrain

*slope angle* is major factor
- < 25, not enough slope
- 25-30, rare
- 30-45, most dangerous
- > 45 degree, too steep for avalanche

*slope size*
- bigger slope is more dangerous, difficult

*sun exposure*
- sun weakens surface, can make slabs, crusts
- melt-freeze cycle can also strengthen
- south "aspect" of mountain, not just south face
- spring (i.e. march) sun is most absorbed, dangerous

*wind exposure*
- wind crusts form on fetch side
- wind slabs form on leeward side
- 30-50km/h winds + loose snow + angle causes wind slabs

*elevation*
- above treeline there is nothing holding snow

*roughness*
- anchoring (rocks, bushes, etc..) can prevent avalanche

### Characteristics of Trigger Point

*slope shape*
- breaks usually on convex slope
- unsupported snow (like on a roof)

*buried obstacle*
- rocks, trees create holes inside layers
- brings warmth inside snowpack

*forest density*
- dense forests mean avalanches don't usually happen here
- many trees are good, few trees can be bad

### Terrain Traps

depression
- where snow will end up deep, bury

trees
- increased risk of trauma

icefall
- danger of falling onto hard surface

gully
- valley where snow will pile up 
- can become an avalanche "river"

crevasse
- difficult to get out of

flat area
- like a road, where snow can sweep you

cliff

## Route Planning 

### Resources

Caltopo

FatMaps

Avalanche.ca

### Avalanche Terrain Exposure Scale (ATES)

ATES provide severity of avalanche terrain
- simple terrain is *still* avalanche terrain

Simple terrain is low angle or primarily forested
Chellinging is exposed but option exist to reduce
Complex large open terrain, lots of traps, hard to reduce exposure

### Avalanche Danger Rating

1. low, watch for small avalanches
2. moderate, heightened, evaluate carefully
3. considerable, careful planning necessary
4. high, not recommended
5. extreme, avoid

split into
- below treeline
- treeline
- alpine

available on avalache.ca

### Dangerator

flowchart when avalanche forecast is not available

start with considerable
- critical loading (30cm+ snow in 24 hours) -> high
- critical warming (temp ~0) -> high

still considerable if any of
- recent loading (30cm+ snow in prev 2 days)
- recent slab avalanches 
- persistent slab problem

moderate if no to all

### Avaluator

combine your danger and terrain rating to decide caution

normal caution
- appropriate for recreational travel
- always watch for isolated slabs

extra caution
- not appropriate for basic training, require advanced skills
- detailed trip planning
- significant personal experience
- group management

not recommended
- not recommended without professional-level safety or guidance

### Logical Fallacies

familiarity
- thinking you know the terrain, paying less attention
- confidence in your skills

acceptance
- not speaking up

commitment
- sunk cost fallacy

expert halo
- trusting the loudest voice without considering total expertise

tracks
- scarcity, getting in "one last run"

social proof
- following others' tracks
- trusting social media examples

### Decision Making

group heurstics
- *group think* not rocking the boat, agreeing 
- *risky shift* choosing riskier option together

mindset
- mindful of changing conditions
- open to change of plans 

situational awareness
- keeping track of new info

judgement
- reflect and consider decisions
- did you manage risk and uncertainty appropriately

uncertainty
- snowpack, terrain, weather
- step back, reduce risk

use systematic decision making
- avaluator, etc..

### Reality Check

- are you comfortable with trip companions?
- is the group size manageable?
- given conditions, are you comfortable with the route?
- do I have the skill and training to use the equipment competently?
- do my companions have the skill and training?
- do you know what to do when an avalanche hits? can you put their life in your hands?
- do your companions know what to do when an avalanche hits? can you put your life in their hands?

### Daily Planning

1. get the forecast
    - dangerator
    - reading forecast
2. plan your trip
    - avaluator
    - navigation
3. check your gear
    - transceiver, probe, and shovel
    - help: first aid, radio, cell phone
    - survive a night: fire starter, clothing, headlamp
4. verify conditions
    - special / regional variability
    - ski resort weather report
5. use good travel habits
    - open communication, two-way radio
    - expose only person at a time
    - group up in safe spots
    - plan escape route
    - look for instabilities, reduce risk
6. evaluate slops
    - select <30 deg slope
    - look for forest density
    - minimize terrain traps
7. reflect
    - create MIN report on avalanche.ca
